This is my README

install gtk,Tkinter and other dependencies for running scripts on raspbery pi.
try running final_testing1.py for communication GUI interface with arduino mega on raspberry pi.

comma_seperated.ino sends the comma_seperated vales of roll and pitch t the raspberry pi.
the above code needs to be put in arduino mega rollpitch.ino

raspberrry pi will receive those values and will store those in some datafile or directly work on it.
those codes are there too.

server1.py ad server2.py are codes for wireless communicaton and we can send info
from one raspberry to other through wireless comm. also data can be sent from 1 server raspberry to many client side raspberry pi's.
